## 🚀 Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to apply **regression algorithms** to predict continuous outcomes from historical and structured data. Below are the key sub-projects included in this repository:

- **[Car Price Prediction](https://github.com/adesh-pawar10/AI-ML-Projects/tree/master/Regression%20Project/Car%20Price%20Prediction)** 🚗
- **[Crop Yield Prediction](https://github.com/adesh-pawar10/AI-ML-Projects/tree/master/Regression%20Project/Crop%20Prediction)** 🌾
- **[Personalized Medicine](https://github.com/adesh-pawar10/AI-ML-Projects/tree/master/Regression%20Project/Personalized%20Medicine)** 💊
- **[Predicting Patient Readmission](https://github.com/adesh-pawar10/AI-ML-Projects/tree/master/Regression%20Project/Predicting%20Patient%20Readmission)** 🏥

Each sub-project focuses on solving specific industry problems using **Linear Regression**, **Polynomial Regression**, and **Decision Tree Regression**, and includes data exploration, model training, and evaluation techniques.
