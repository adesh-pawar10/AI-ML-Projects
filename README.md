## 📊 Projects Overview

### **Clustering Project** 🧩  
The **Clustering Project** applies clustering algorithms like **KMeans**, **DBSCAN**, and **Hierarchical Clustering** to categorize players based on their skillset and performance attributes from the **FIFA 23 dataset**.

#### **Key Features of the Clustering Project**:
- **Player Attributes**: Performance metrics like **Overall**, **Potential**, **Pace**, **Shooting**, **Passing**, **Dribbling**, **Defending**, **Physicality**, and more.
- **Physical Attributes**: **Height**, **Weight**, **Strength**, **Stamina**.
- **Financial Metrics**: **Value**, **Wage**.
- **Categorical Features**: **Nationality**, **Club Name**.

This project applies unsupervised learning algorithms to group players based on similarities in their attributes, helping managers and analysts find the best replacements or suitable positions for players.

#### **Algorithms Used**:
- **KMeans**: A popular clustering algorithm used for segmenting players into distinct groups based on their features.
- **DBSCAN**: Density-based spatial clustering algorithm, ideal for identifying clusters with arbitrary shapes and detecting outliers.
- **Hierarchical Clustering**: Builds a tree-like structure (dendrogram) to represent nested clusters.
